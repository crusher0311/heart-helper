# Creating Icons for the Extension

The extension needs three icon sizes. Since ImageMagick is not available, you can:

## Option 1: Use Any Image Editor
Create three PNG files with a solid blue (#3b82f6) background:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Option 2: Use Online Tools
Visit https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/ or similar tools to generate icons.

## Option 3: Use Existing Icons (Temporary)
The extension will work without icons, they just won't display in the toolbar.

For now, you can skip icon creation - the extension is fully functional without them.
